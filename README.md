# Regularization Techniques in Machine Learning

A Python-based workflow demonstrating the effect of regularization techniques on model performance using structured CSV data.

---

## Overview

This repository focuses on **regularization in supervised machine learning**, illustrating how different regularization methods help:
- Control model complexity
- Reduce overfitting
- Improve generalization on unseen data

The analysis is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and applies regularization concepts to a real dataset for hands-on experimentation.
